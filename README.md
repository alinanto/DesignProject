## ABSTRACT
The full utility of a household or industrial energy meter can
be utilised if it can be interface with a communication device.
Since GSM communication is the most portable device
based communication, the same can be applied for energy
meter. Digital type device is selected to make the meter
smart and reliable. Automation has become a necessity in
the modern world. Human labour is considered unwanted
even in the most simplest or crucial of the tasks which can
be automated. This reduces mistakes due to human error.
Energy conservation is also a main driving factor which has
led to the selection of this particular product.
